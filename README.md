##JavaScript Particle Text Animation - https://64a675151d362251344d43e3--gleaming-dasik-9d9d2b.netlify.app/
This project is a JavaScript-based particle text animation that creates an eye-catching visual effect using particles and text. The animation is achieved through custom coding without the use of any external libraries.

How It Works
The animation is created by manipulating individual particles on a canvas to form the desired text. Each particle is given properties such as position, velocity, size, and color. By continuously updating these properties and redrawing the particles on the canvas, a dynamic motion effect is achieved.

Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code files.

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

You should see the particle text animation displayed on the webpage.

Customizing the Animation
To modify the text used in the animation, you can make changes to the JavaScript code. Open the script.js file and locate the following line of code:

javascript
Copy code
const text = "Your Text Here";
Replace "Your Text Here" with the desired text you want to animate. For example:

javascript
Copy code
const text = "Hello, World!";
After making the change, save the file and refresh the webpage to see the updated animation with your chosen text.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different ways to enhance the particle text animation.

Compatibility
This project is built using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas, which are supported by modern web browsers. For the best experience, ensure that your browser is up to date.

Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by various particle animation techniques found across the web. While no external libraries were used, the general concept of particle animations has been widely explored in the development community.
